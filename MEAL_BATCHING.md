# Meal Batching System

This implements the end-of-day summary approach for nutrient logging that minimizes LLM calls while providing flexibility for users.

## Key Features

### üéØ **End-of-Day Summary (Default Flow)**
- Users log meals throughout the day as raw text
- Single LLM call processes all meals at day's end
- Cost-efficient: 1 call per day instead of 1 per meal

### ‚ö° **Quick Meal Capture**
- Users can log meals mid-day without triggering LLM processing
- Raw text is stored locally for later batching
- No immediate cost - just storage

### ‚úèÔ∏è **Post-Hoc Edits**
- Users can make corrections after seeing LLM results
- Limited to 1-2 edits per day to control costs
- Validates consistency and provides warnings

### üìä **Simplified Schema**
- Focus on macros + calories only (no micronutrients for now)
- Clear breakdown: totals + individual meal items
- Easy to understand and validate

## Workflow

### 1. Quick Meal Logging
```python
# User logs meals throughout the day
log_meal("Breakfast: 2 eggs, toast, coffee")
log_meal("Lunch: chicken salad with quinoa")
log_meal("Dinner: salmon with vegetables")
```

### 2. Daily Summary Processing
```python
# At end of day, process all meals with single LLM call
summary = process_daily_summary()
```

### 3. Results Display
```

## Chat Interface Integration

The system integrates with a button-based UI for clean user experience:

### Button-Based Workflow
```
User clicks "Nutrient Logging" button
Bot: "üçΩÔ∏è I can help you with nutrition tracking! Are you:

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Logging a single meal**
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Logging your whole day's nutrition**

Please choose which one you'd like to do."

User clicks "Single Meal" button
Bot: "Got it! You're logging a single meal. Please tell me what you ate."

User: "I had breakfast: 2 eggs scrambled with 1 tbsp butter, 2 slices whole wheat toast"
Bot: "‚úÖ Single meal logged successfully!"
```

### Log Whole Day
```
User clicks "Nutrient Logging" button
Bot: [Shows same single meal vs whole day options]

User clicks "Whole Day" button  
Bot: "Perfect! You're logging your whole day's nutrition. Please tell me everything you ate today."

User: "Today I had breakfast: 2 eggs and toast, lunch: chicken salad with quinoa, dinner: salmon with vegetables"
Bot: [Shows detailed nutrition breakdown immediately]
```

### Process Daily Summary
```
User clicks "Daily Summary" button
Bot: [Shows detailed nutrition breakdown of all pending meals]
```

## Database Schema

### RawMealInput
- Stores raw meal text before LLM processing
- Tracks processing status and edit count
- Indexed by user_id and date

### DailyNutritionSummary
- Stores processed nutrition data from LLM
- Links to raw meal inputs used
- Tracks edit count for cost control

## Cost Benefits

- **Before**: 1 LLM call per meal (e.g., 4 meals = 4 calls)
- **After**: 1 LLM call per day (e.g., 4 meals = 1 call)
- **Savings**: ~75% reduction in LLM costs for typical usage

## Setup

1. Run database migration:
```bash
python migrate_db.py
```

2. Start the server:
```bash
uvicorn app.api:app --reload
```

3. Test with example:
```bash
python example_usage.py
```

## Future Enhancements

- Add micronutrient tracking
- Implement meal templates
- Add photo recognition for meals
- Create weekly/monthly summaries
- Add nutrition goal tracking
